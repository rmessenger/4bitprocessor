# 4bitprocessor
This is an educational 4-bit processor designed in LogicWorks during a college course on the fundamentals of digital circuit design. The course is tought at Chandler-Gilbert Community College by Bassam Matar. I have extended the design of the processor beyond the requirements of the course, including a full instruction set and assembler written in C.
